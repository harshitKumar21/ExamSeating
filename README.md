# ExamSeating
This project develops a smart exam seating system using graph coloring algorithms to prevent malpractice. It assigns students so that no two adjacent seats have the same subject. Using Greedy and Backtracking techniques, it generates seating plans from CSV input, with outputs in grid form downloadable as CSV, Excel, or PDF.
